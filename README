The WebShopApps logger is an in-admin logging facility for our Magento extensions.

The logger was developed to enable our customers to:

Get some re-assurance their extensions are working correctly
Get some key indicators that help resolve issues and links to support docs to help resolve any problems caused by misconfiguration of the extension.

The logger is very simple to integrate into your own extensions to provide your customers with the benefits it provides ours and its key features are:

1. Ability to debug on a per extension basis
2. Dedicated log panel within admin, no need to open log files
3. Ability to set logging level to show more/less logs
4.  Log to admin, file system and/or via email
5.  Runs asynchronously, reducing impact on performance to a minimum
6. Ability to switch off when in production, will not affect performance at all
7. Periodic Cron job which clears out WebShopApps extension related logs from the database

Installation steps

Switch off the Magento Compiler if enabled under System->Tools->Compilation
Ensure Cache is disabled in Admin
Copy the app directory into your Magento base directory overwriting any files. *
Note: This does not overwrite any core files~
Logout of your admin and log back into your admin to refresh Magento admin permissions so you can access the newly installed logger.
