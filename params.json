{"name":"Wsalogger","body":"The WebShopApps logger is an in-admin logging facility for our Magento extensions.\r\n\r\nThe logger was developed to enable our customers to:\r\n\r\n* Get some re-assurance their extensions are working correctly\r\n* Get some key indicators that help resolve issues and links to support docs to help resolve any problems caused by  misconfiguration of the extension.\r\n\r\nThe logger is very simple to integrate into your own extensions to provide your customers with the benefits it provides ours and its key features are:\r\n\r\n1. Ability to debug on a per extension basis\r\n2. Dedicated log panel within admin, no need to open log files\r\n3. Ability to set logging level to show more/less logs\r\n4. Log to admin, file system and/or via email\r\n5. Ability to switch off when in production, will not affect performance at all\r\n6. Periodic Cron job which clears out WebShopApps extension related logs from the database\r\n\r\n**Installation steps**\r\n\r\n1. Switch off the Magento Compiler if enabled under System->Tools->Compilation\r\n2. Ensure Cache is disabled in Admin\r\n3. Copy the app directory into your Magento base directory overwriting any files. *\r\n   Note: This does not overwrite any core files~\r\n4. Logout of your admin and log back into your admin to refresh Magento admin permissions so you can access the newly installed logger.\r\n\r\n**How to use in your own extension code**\r\n\r\nThe extension provides 4 levels of logging that the end user can choose to output in their Magento admin panel which are Critical, Warning, Info and Debug.\r\n\r\nThe example below shows how to set debug logs:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Webshopapps_SpecialDiscountExtension\r\n{\r\n  public function pointsCalculator($points){\r\n     \r\n     //Determine if logging is enabled\r\n     $debug = Mage::helper('wsalogger')->isDebug('Webshopapps_SpecialDiscountExtension');\r\n     $discount = 0;\r\n\r\n      if($points >= 40 && < 60){\r\n         $discount = 10;\r\n       }\r\n      else{\r\n         $discount = 5;\r\n       }\r\n\r\n      //if logging is enabled then log out the discount amount\r\n      if ($debug){\r\n        Mage::helper('wsalogger/log')->postDebug('id', 'Discount Amount', $discount);\r\n       }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nInformation on how to enable, configure and view the logs from the logger in Magento Admin is available on our [wiki](http://wiki.webshopapps.com/webshopapps-logger)","tagline":"WebShopApps Magento Logger Utility","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
